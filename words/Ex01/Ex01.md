## I was originally going to do this the "normal person" way, but idc

#1. `bool isA = (90 <= grade <= 100);`

Computers don't like more than one comparison in one go. They prefer this

`bool isA = (90 <= grade && grade <= 100);`

#2. ```double x = (double) (3/5);
cout << x```
> 0 //Perfectly logical, because you forced the double type **after** the result, which is already int, and thus, 0

Making one of them double solves this immediately

`double x = (double)3/5;`

#3. ```int x = 65536;
long y = x * x;
cout << y;```

Same as #2

`long y = (long) x*x` or `long x = 65536`

#4. `(Math.sqrt(2) * Math.sqrt(2) == 2)`

> 0 //Same deal, type differences.

#5. FLOATING POINT ERROR TIME BOYS.

#6. Obiviously invalid operand. This is not JS.

Also nothing, except you get random noises instead of valid numbers.

#7. 

>0 // int/int -> int

>0.75 

>0.75

>0.75 //All have at least a double typed value

#8. Conflicting declearation

#9/#10. The one inside. Scopes.

#11. Another #4 classic

#12. Nothing. You escaped the `else` statement
